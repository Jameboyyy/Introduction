:wink: About Me

Hello there! My name is James Daniel Cadavona. I am a 21 year old Front End Software Engineer studying at California State University, Fullerton. I am pursuing a B.S in Computer Science expected in May 2024.

:computer: I enjoy creating modern websites and improving my skills as a UI/UX developer. I learned HTML5, CSS3, ,JavaScript ES6+ and React in the summer of 2022. I am currently in the process of finishing Front End Simplified by David Bragg. Besides of web development, I wish to explore ios development and swift.

:dancers: :basketball: Outside of Software Engineering, I enjoy making choreography to music I like to help with my creativity as well as to keep my body in healthy form. On the weekend, I also like to play basketball at my local gym to help keep my mind at ease.
